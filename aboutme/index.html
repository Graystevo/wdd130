    <h2>"Gray"</h2>
    <p>My name is Grayden Stevens, and I am studying for a degree in info tech. I live in St. George Utah, but I travel a lot to keep up with my mom. My main focus is cybersec, with a huge passion for red team stuff. Pentesting and all that. I am unmarried, and live with my mom wherever she goes, making online education like this particularly advantageous for me. I don't ever have to leave her side!</p> <p> I do not have a current job, though I worked previously at a datacenter for two years as a network operation center operator. Sort of a glorified janitor really, but I handled plenty of customer support and remote hands work. My primary reason for taking a web dev class is because I deeply enjoy web app based pentesting, yet I only have a vague understanding of the wctual way webpages are built and made. Having a deeper understanding will help me break them in new and interesting ways better than before. </p>
